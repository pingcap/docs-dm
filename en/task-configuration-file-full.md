# DM Advanced Task Configuration File

This document introduces the advanced task configuration file of Data Migration --
[`task_advanced.yaml`](https://github.com/pingcap/dm/blob/master/dm/master/task_advanced.yaml), including [global configuration](#global-configuration) and [instance configuration](#instance-configuration).

For the feature and configuration of each configuration item, see [Data replication features](feature-overview.md).

## Important concepts

For description of important concepts including `source-id` and the DM-worker ID, see [Important concepts](config-overview.md#important-concepts).

## Disable checking items

DM checks items according to the task type, see [Disable checking items](precheck.md#disable-checking-items). You can use `ignore-checking-items` in the task configuration file to disable checking items.

## Task configuration file template (advanced)

The following is the task configuration file template which allows you to perform **advanced** data replication tasks.

```yaml

    safe-mode: false                 # If set to true, `INSERT` statements from upstream are rewritten to `REPLACE` statements, and `UPDATE` statements are rewritten to `DELETE` and `REPLACE` statements. This ensures that DML statements can be imported repeatedly during data replication when there is any primary key or unique index in the table schema. TiDB DM automatically enables safe mode within the first 5 minutes after starting or resuming replication tasks.

## Configuration order

1. Edit the [global configuration](#global-configuration).
2. Edit the [instance configuration](#instance-configuration) based on the global configuration.

## Global configuration

### Basic configuration

Refer to the comments in the [template](#task-configuration-file-template-advanced) to see more details. Detailed explanations about `task-mode` are as follows:

- Description: the task mode that can be used to specify the data replication task to be executed.
- Value: string (`full`, `incremental`, or `all`).
    - `full` only makes a full backup of the upstream database and then imports the full data to the downstream database.
    - `incremental`: Only replicates the incremental data of the upstream database to the downstream database using the binlog. You can set the `meta` configuration item of the instance configuration to specify the starting position of incremental replication.
    - `all`: `full` + `incremental`. Makes a full backup of the upstream database, imports the full data to the downstream database, and then uses the binlog to make an incremental replication to the downstream database starting from the exported position during the full backup process (binlog position).

### Feature configuration set

Arguments in each feature configuration set are explained in the comments in the [template](#task-configuration-file-template-advanced).

| Parameter        | Description                                    |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| `routes` | The routing mapping rule set between the upstream and downstream tables. If the names of the upstream and downstream schemas and tables are the same, this item does not need to be configured. See [Table Routing](feature-overview.md#table-routing) for usage scenarios and sample configurations. |
| `filters` | The binlog event filter rule set of the matched table of the upstream database instance. If binlog filtering is not required, this item does not need to be configured. See [Binlog Event Filter](feature-overview.md#binlog-event-filter) for usage scenarios and sample configurations. |
| `block-allow-list` | The filter rule set of the block and allow list of the matched table of the upstream database instance. It is recommended to specify the schemas and tables that need to be replicated through this item, otherwise all schemas and tables are replicated. See [Binlog Event Filter](feature-overview.md#binlog-event-filter)[Block & Allow Lists](feature-overview.md#block-and-allow-table-lists) for usage scenarios and sample configurations. |
| `mydumpers` | Configuration arguments of Mydumper processing unit. If the default configuration is sufficient for your needs, this item does not need to be configured. Or you can configure `thread` only using `mydumper-thread`. |
| `loaders` | Configuration arguments of Loader processing unit. If the default configuration is sufficient for your needs, this item does not need to be configured. Or you can configure `pool-size` only using `loader-thread`. |
| `syncers` | Configuration arguments of Syncer processing unit. If the default configuration is sufficient for your needs, this item does not need to be configured. Or you can configure `worker-count` only using `syncer-thread`. |

## Instance configuration

This part defines the subtask of data replication. DM supports replicating data from one or multiple MySQL instances in the upstream to the same instance in the downstream.

For the configuration details of the above options, see the corresponding part in [Feature configuration set](#feature-configuration-set), as shown in the following table.

| Option | Corresponding part |
| :------ | :------------------ |
| `route-rules` | `routes` |
| `filter-rules` | `filters` |
| `block-allow-list` | `block-allow-list` |
| `mydumper-config-name` | `mydumpers` |
| `loader-config-name` | `loaders` |
| `syncer-config-name` | `syncers`  |
