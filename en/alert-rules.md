# DM Alert Information

The [alert system](migrate-data-using-dm.md#step-7-monitor-the-task-and-check-logs) is deployed by default when you deploy a DM cluster using DM-Ansible.

> **Note:**
>
> There are alert rules provided with DM-worker only.

For more information about DM alert rules and the solutions, refer to [handle alerts](handle-alerts.md).

Both DM alert information and monitoring metrics are based on Prometheus. For more information about their relationship, refer to [DM monitoring metrics](monitor-a-dm-cluster.md).
