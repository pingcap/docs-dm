# Pause a Data Replication Task

You can use the `pause-task` command to pause a data replication task.

`pause-task` differs from `stop-task` in that:

- `pause-task` only pauses a replication task. You can query the status information (retained in the memory) of the task using `query-status`. `stop-task` terminates a replication task and removes all information related to this task from the memory. This means you cannot use `query-status` to query the status information. `dm_meta` like "checkpoint" and data that have been replicated to the downstream are not removed.
- If `pause-task` is executed to pause the replication task, you cannot start a new task with the same name, neither can you get the relay log of the paused task removed, since this task does exist. If `stop-task` is executed to stop a task, you can start a new task with the same name, and you can get the relay log of the stopped task removed, since this task no longer exists.
- `pause-task` is usually used to pause a task for troubleshooting, while `stop-task` is to permanently remove a replication task, or to co-work with `start-task` to update the configuration information.
