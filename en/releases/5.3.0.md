# DM 5.3.0 Release Notes

Release date: November 30, 2021

DM version: 5.3.0

## Special Notes

As of DM v2.0, DM uses a TiDB-independent version number; after DM v2.0, DM uses the same version number as TiDB. Therefore, the next version of DM v2.0 is DM v5.3. There are no compatibility changes from DM v2.0 to v5.3, and the upgrade process is no different from a normal upgrade, only an increase in version number.
