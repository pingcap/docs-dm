# DM 5.3.0 Release Notes

Release date: November 30, 2021

DM version: 5.3.0

## Special Notes

In earlier versions (v1.0 and v2.0), DM uses version numbers that are independent of TiDB. Since v5.3, DM uses the same version number as TiDB. The next version of DM v2.0 is DM v5.3. There are no compatibility changes from DM v2.0 to v5.3, and the upgrade process is no different from a normal upgrade, only an increase in version number.
