# DM 1.0.6 Release Notes

Release date: June 17, 2020

DM version: 1.0.6

DM-Ansible version: 1.0.6

## Improvements

- Support the original plaintext passwords for upstream and downstream databases
- Support configuring session variables for DM’s connections to upstream and downstream databases
- Remove the call stack information in some error messages returned by the `query-status` command when the data migration task encounters an exception 
- Filter out the items that pass the precheck from the message returned when the precheck of the data migration task fails

## Bug fixes

- Fix the issue that the data migration task is not automatically paused and the error cannot be identified by executing the `query-status` command if an error occurs when the load unit creates a table 
- Fix possible DM-worker panics when data migration tasks run simultaneously 
- Fix the issue that the existing data migration task cannot be automatically restarted when the DM-worker process is restarted if the `enable-heartbeat` parameter of the task is set to `true` 
- Fix the issue that the shard DDL conflict error may not be returned after the task is resumed 
- Fix the issue that the `replicate lag` information is displayed incorrectly for an initial period of time when the `enable-heartbeat` parameter of  the data migration task is set to `true` 
- Fix the issue that `replicate lag` cannot be calculated using the heartbeat information when `lower_case_table_names` is set to `1` in the upstream database 
- Disable the meaningless auto-resume tasks triggered by the `unsupported collation` error during data migration
