# DM 2.0 RC Release Notes

Release date: August 21, 2020

DM version: 2.0.0-rc

## Improvements

- Support high availability for data migration tasks
- Add an optimistic mode for sharding DDL statements
- Add the `handle-error` command to handle errors during DDL incremental replication
- Add a `workaround` field in the error returned by `query-status` to suggest the error handling method
- Improve the monitoring dashboards and alert rules
- Replace Mydumper with Dumpling as the full export unit
- Support the GTID mode when performing incremental replication to the downstream
- Support TLS connections between upstream and downstream databases, and between DM components
- Support the incremental replication scenarios where the table of the downstream has more columns than that of the upstream
- Add a `--remove-meta` option to the `start-task` command to clean up metadata related to data migration tasks
- Support dropping columns with single-column indices
- Support automatically cleaning up temporary files after a successful full import
- Support checking whether the table to be migrated has a primary key or a unique key before starting a migration task
- Support connectivity check between dmctl and DM-master while starting dmctl
- Support connectivity check for downstream TiDB during the execution of `start-task`/`check-task`
- Support replacing task names with task configuration files for some commands such as `pause-task`
- Support logs in `json` format for DM-master and DM-worker components
- Remove the call stack information and redundant fields in the error message returned by `query-status`
- Improve the binlog position information of the upstream database returned by `query-status`
- Improve the processing of `auto resume` when an error is encountered during the full export

## Bug fixes

- Fix the issue of goroutine leak after executing `stop-task`
- Fix the issue that the task might not be paused after executing `pause-task`
- Fix the issue that the checkpoint might not be saved correctly in the initial stage of incremental replication
- Fix the issue that the `BIT` data type is incorrectly handled during incremental replication
