# DM Portal Overview

Data Migration (DM) provides a variety of features, including [table routing](feature-overview.md#table-routing), [block & allow table lists](feature-overview.md#block-and-allow-table-lists), and [binlog event filter](feature-overview.md#binlog-event-filter). However, these features also increase the complexity of using DM, especially when users are modifying [DM task configurations](task-configuration-file.md).

To address this problem, DM provides a simple web application, DM Portal. DM Portal enables users to visually configure the required migration tasks, and generates a `task.yaml` file that can be directly executed by DM.

## Features

This sections describes the features of DM Portal.

### Configure the migration mode

DM Portal supports three migration modes:

- Full migration
- Incremental replication
- All (full + incremental)

### Configure the instance information

DM Portal supports configuring table routing, and merging sharded schemas and tables in DM.

### Configure the binlog event filter

DM Portal supports configuring the binlog event filter in schemas and tables.

### Generate the configuration file

DM Portal supports generating configuration files and downloading these files to your local computer. Meanwhile, it automatically creates a file in the `/tmp/` directory on the dm-portal server.

## Restrictions

Currently, DM Portal's visualized pages cover most DM configuration scenarios, but with the following restrictions:

- The SQL pattern of [binlog event filter](feature-overview.md#binlog-event-filter) is not supported.

- The editing feature does not support parsing the `task.yaml` file created by the user. The user can only edit the `task.yaml` file generated by the page.

- The editing feature does not support modifying the instance configuration. If the user need to adjust the instance configuration, the `task.yaml` file has to be regenerated.

- The upstream instance configuration on the page can only be used to obtain the upstream table schema. The related upstream instance information still needs to be configured in DM-worker.

- In the generated `task.yaml` file, mydumper-path is `./bin/mydumper` by default. If you use another path, modify the generated `task.yaml` file manually.

## Deploy

This section describes how to deploy DM Portal in two ways: using binary or DM Ansible.

### Deploy using binary

Download DM Portal at [dm-portal-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz](https://download.pingcap.org/dm-portal-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz). To start DM Portal, run the `./dm-portal` command.

- If you run DM Portal locally, visit `127.0.0.1:8280` in your browser.
- If you run DM Portal on a server, configure a proxy on the server.

### Deploy using DM Ansible

To deploy DM Portal using DM Ansible, refer to [Deploy Data Migration Using DM-Ansible](deploy-a-dm-cluster-using-ansible.md) for details.

## Usage

This section describes how to use DM Portal.

### Create rules

This feature is used to create a `task.yaml` file.

#### Operation steps

Access the dm-portal page, and click **Create New Rule**.

### Configure the basic information

This feature is used to fill in the task name and select a task type.

#### Prerequisites

**Create New Sync Rule** is already selected.

#### Operation steps

1. Fill in the task name.
2. Choose a task type.

### Configure the instance information

This feature is used to configure the upstream and downstream instance information, including Host, Port, Username, and Password.

#### Prerequisites

**Task Name** and **Task Type** are already filled in.

> **Note:**
>
> If you choose **Incremental** or **All** in Task Type, you need to configure binlog-file and binlog-pos when configuring the upstream instance information.

#### Operation steps

1. Fill in the upstream instance information.
2. Fill in the downstream instance information.
3. Click **Next**.

### Configure the binlog filter

This feature is used to filter the upstream binlog. You can choose the DDL or DML that needs to be filtered. The filter configured on the database is automatically inherited by tables in that database.

#### Prerequisites

- The upstream and downstream instance information is configured.
- The connection is verified.

> **Note:**
>
> - The binlog filter configuration can only be modified in the upstream instance. Once the database or table is moved to the downstream instance, the configuration cannot be modified.
> - The binlog filter configured on the database is automatically inherited by tables in that database.

#### Operation steps

1. Select the databases or tables that need to be configured.

2. Click the **Edit** button, and select the binlog types to be filtered.

![DM Portal BinlogFilter 2](/media/en/dm-portal-binlogfilter-2-en.png)

### Configure table routing

This feature is used to perform the following operations:

- Select the databases and tables that need to be synced, modify their names, and merge databases and tables
- Revert the last operation
- Reset all configurations of table routing

After the task configuration is completed, DM Portal generates the corresponding `task.yaml` file.

#### Prerequisites

The required binlog filter rules are configured.

> **Note:**
>
> - Batch operation is not supported when you merge databases and tables. You can only drag them one by one.
> - You can only drag tables when you merge databases and tables. You cannot drag databases.

#### Operation steps

1. Select the databases and tables that need to be synced from **Upstream Instance**.

2. Click the **Move** button and move the selected databases and tables to **Downstream Instance**.

3. Right click the databases and tables to rename them.

4. Select the required table to perform the following operation:

    - To merge two tables, drag the table onto another table

        ![DM Portal MergeTable 2](/media/en/dm-portal-mergetable-2-en.png)

    - To move the table to an existing database, drag the table onto the database

        ![DM Portal MoveToDB 2](/media/en/dm-portal-movetodb-2-en.png)

    - To move the table to a new database, drag the table onto the `target-instance` icon

        ![DM Portal MoveToNewDB 2](/media/en/dm-portal-movetonewdb-2-en.png)

5. Click **Go Back** to undo the last operation.

    ![DM Portal Revert](/media/en/dm-portal-revert-en.png)

6. Click **Reset** to clear the downstream instance.

    ![DM Portal Reset](/media/en/dm-portal-reset-en.png)

7. Click **Finish & Download**. DM Portal automatically downloads the `task.yaml` file to the local computer, and creates a `task.yaml` configuration file in the `/tmp/` directory on the DM Portal server.
