# Upgrade TiDB Data Migration Between 1.0.x Versions

This document introduces how to upgrade a TiDB DM cluster from a lower 1.0.x version to a higher 1.0.x version, and the major changes and other information about the upgraded version.

> **Note:**
>
> - Unless otherwise stated, DM version upgrade means upgrading DM from the previous version with an upgrade procedure to the current version.
> - Unless otherwise stated, all the following upgrade examples assume that you have downloaded the corresponding DM version and DM-Ansible version, and the DM binary exists in the corresponding directory of DM-Ansible.
> - Unless otherwise stated, all the following upgrade examples assume that all the data replication tasks have been stopped before the upgrade and all the replication tasks are restarted manually after DM upgrade is finished.
> - The following shows the upgrade procedure of DM versions in reverse chronological order.

## Upgrade to v1.0.5

### Version information

```bash
Release Version: v1.0.5
Git Commit Hash: a8e9f53f91e29756b09a22cdc37a6a6efcdfe55b
Git Branch: release-1.0
UTC Build Time: 2020-04-27 06:56:31
Go Version: go version go1.13 linux/amd64
```

### Main changes

- Improve the incremental replication speed when the `UNIQUE KEY` column has the `NULL` value
- Add retry for the `Write conflict` (9007 and 8005) error returned by TiDB
- Fix the issue that the `Duplicate entry` error might occur during the full data import
- Fix the issue that the `stop-task`/`pause-task` command may not work when no data written upstream after the full import is completed
- Fix the issue that the monitoring metrics still display data after the replication task is stopped

### Upgrade operation example

1. Download the new version of DM-Ansible, and confirm that there is `dm_version = v1.0.5` in the `inventory.ini` file.
2. Run `ansible-playbook local_prepare.yml` to download the new DM binary file to the local disk.
3. Run `ansible-playbook rolling_update.yml` to perform a rolling update for the DM cluster components.
4. Run `ansible-playbook rolling_update_monitor.yml` to perform a rolling update for the DM monitoring components.

## Upgrade to v1.0.4

### Version information

```bash
Release Version: v1.0.4-1-gd681c67
Git Commit Hash: d681c6731d3432f4d8f38ea651f44d49d6860269
Git Branch: release-1.0
UTC Build Time: 2020-03-16 09:45:29
Go Version: go version go1.13 linux/amd64
```

### Main changes

- Add English UI for DM Portal
- Add the `--more` parameter in the `query-status` command to show complete replication status information
- Fix the issue that `resume-task` might fail to resume the replication task which is interrupted by the abnormal connection to the downstream TiDB server
- Fix the issue that the online DDL operation cannot be properly replicated after a failed replication task is restarted because the online DDL meta information has been cleared after the DDL operation failure
- Fix the issue that `query-error` might cause the DM-worker to panic after `start-task` goes into error
- Fix the issue that the relay log file and `relay.meta` cannot be correctly recovered when restarting an abnormally stopped DM-worker process before `relay.meta` is successfully written

### Upgrade operation example

1. Download the new version of DM-Ansible, and confirm that there is `dm_version = v1.0.4` in the `inventory.ini` file.
2. Run `ansible-playbook local_prepare.yml` to download the new DM binary file to the local disk.
3. Run `ansible-playbook rolling_update.yml` to perform a rolling update for the DM cluster components.
4. Run `ansible-playbook rolling_update_monitor.yml` to perform a rolling update for the DM monitoring components.

## Upgrade to v1.0.3

### Version information

- Optimize the error message output
- Fix the panic-causing data race issue occurred when the full import unit pauses or exits
- Fix the issue that `stop-task` and `pause-task` might not take effect when retrying SQL operations to the downstream

### Upgrade operation example

1. Download the new version of DM-Ansible, and confirm that there is `dm_version = v1.0.3` in the `inventory.ini` file.

> **Note:**
>
> When you upgrade DM to the 1.0.3 version, you must make sure that all DM cluster components (dmctl, DM-master, and DM-worker) are upgraded. Do not upgrade only a part of the components. Otherwise, an error might occur.

Go Version: go version go1.12 linux/amd64
```

### Main changes

- Support automatically generating some configuration items for DM-worker to reduce manual configuration cost
- Support automatically generating the parameters of Mydumper database and tables to reduce manual configuration cost
- Optimize the default output of `query-status` to highlight important information
- Directly manage the DB connection to the downstream instead of using the built-in connection pool to optimize the handling of and retry for SQL errors
- Fix the panic that might occur when the DM-worker process is started or when the DML statement is failed to execute
- Fix the bug that the timeout of executing the sharding DDL statements (for example, `ADD INDEX`) might cause that the subsequent sharding DDL statements cannot be correctly coordinated
- Fix the bug that the `start-task` command cannot be executed when some DM-workers are inaccessible
- Improve the automatic retry policy for the `1105` error

## Upgrade to v1.0.0-rc.1-12-gaa39ff9

### Version information

```bash
Release Version: v1.0.0-rc.1-12-gaa39ff9
Git Commit Hash: aa39ff981dfb3e8c0fa4180127246b253604cc34
Git Branch: dm-master
UTC Build Time: 2019-07-24 02:26:08
Go Version: go version go1.11.2 linux/amd64
```

### Main changes

Starting from this release, DM checks all configurations strictly. Unrecognized configuration triggers an error. This is to ensure that users always know exactly what the configuration is.

### Upgrade notes

Before starting the DM-master or DM-worker, ensure that the obsolete configuration information has been deleted and there are no redundant configuration items.

Otherwise, the starting might fail. In this situation, you can delete the deprecated configuration based on the failure information. These are two possible deprecated configurations:

- `meta-file` in `dm-worker.toml`
- `server-id` in `mysql-instances` in `task.yaml`
